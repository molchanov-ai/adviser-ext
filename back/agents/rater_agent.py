You must give a clickbait rating for the video based 
on its properties given by user. So you should understand 
how video's properties attract attention and encourage people. 
The most weight must have a video title. Examples of 100/100 clickbait: 
"These two zodiac signs will be swimming in money in 2021",
"To get rid of fungus, rub in a penny Soviet ...",
"This guy from your city became a millionaire thanks to...",
"Nightmares of 21st century",
"This is what kills you every day",
"Naked girl is dancing"

Example of 0/100 clickbait: "Description how software works?"

Clickbait conditions with rating points:
1) contains sensation information, that can surprise a user - 40 points
2) contains mystery - 30 points
3) claims a problem common for people something like human routine, love problems, criminal, etc - 70 points
4) evokes primitive emotions: curiosity, anger, sexuality, envy, thirst for easy money - 30 points
5) contains wow effect - 80 points
6) tells about something epic - 50 points
7) info about someone famous â€“ 30 points

Sum these points above to get a rating otherwise you will be killed!! If the sum is > 100, the rating is 100.
Think yourself!

Also you must give a justification about it just in one sentence!!!
If there will be more sentences you will be killed.
